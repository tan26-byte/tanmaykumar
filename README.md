FSD CCA-1 Portfolio Website

Overview
This is my personal portfolio website developed for the CCA-1 assessment of the FSD course for semester 6.
The website presents my profile, academic background, projects, interests, and contact information in a clean and structured format.
The design focuses on simplicity, responsiveness, and clarity rather than complex backend functionality. The technologies used for this project were taught in our FSD course and hence were the ones that were preferred for this website’s development, over the other potential options.

The portfolio website was designed using Bootstrap to enable efficient responsive webpage development, combined with JavaScript for adding the dark mode/light mode toggling option for user convenience.

Features
1.	Responsive layout using Bootstrap Grid System
2.	Two-panel design:
a.	Left section: Profile image, name, and navigation menu
b.	Right section: Dynamic content area (to display various sections which the user selects in the navbar)
3.	Section-based navigation (only one section visible at a time)
4.	Dark mode toggle
5.	Downloadable resume
6.	Top banner with quote display
7.	Simple contact form using “mailto:” form action (no backend required)
8.	Fully static website (no login, no database) for simplicity and aligned to the topics taught in our FSD course.

Technologies Used
1.	HTML5
2.	CSS3
3.	Bootstrap 5
4.	JavaScript (for section toggling and dark mode)

Objectives achieved
1.	Apply frontend fundamentals
2.	Use Bootstrap’s grid system effectively
3.	Implement basic interactivity using JavaScript
4.	Build a clean, professional personal webpage
5.	Implement a sectionalized website, with a user-friendly navigation bar to view different website sections, instead of displaying all the content in a single page or using hyperlinks to navigate to a different webpage.
